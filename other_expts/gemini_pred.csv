The person then picks up the book and puts it back on the shelf.

The person then continues to dust the books. They are almost finished when they find a book that they are interested in. They take the book off the shelf and start to read it. The person is so engrossed in the book that they forget about cleaning the rest of the books.

The person eventually finishes reading the book and they put it back on the shelf. They then finish dusting the books and they leave the room.
